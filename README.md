# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with "O" and "X". The primary goal is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
The game provides a user-friendly interface and includes features such as resetting the game, displaying a winner, and handling draw scenarios. The project includes HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality to manage game logic and user interactions.
